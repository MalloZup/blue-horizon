    The solution will deploy the needed Azure infrastructure for SAP Netweaver and SAP HANA
    and provision and configure the virtual machines and install the SAP application for you.

    As SAP sizing can be complex, a simplified sizing approach is used.
    With the well known concept of T-Shirt sizes S,M,L we provide a simple way of using different settings.

    Behind such T-Shirt sizes, we use the right Azure instance and the needed number of disks with the right size.
    The Demo and S size are thought for non-production, the M and L will use SAP certified instance types and can be used for production scenarios.
    Below is a rought estimation about the SAPS behind the three sizes:

    * Small  <  30.000 SAPS
    * Medium <  70.000 SAPS
    * Large  < 180.000 SAPS

    **Please be aware that it may require a high amount of resources, therefore an increase of your quota could be necessary**.

    For a more advanced customization you will need to get your hands dirty and work directly with the source project: https://github.com/SUSE/ha-sap-terraform-deployments

    ## Pre-requirements
    1. You need to have ssh-keys to be able to access the deployed machines.

    2. The SAP software must be available in Azure, in order to be installed by the solution.

        The SAP software can be downloaded from https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/softwarecenter

    3. In order to provide the SAP software in Azure, please create a storage account in your Azure subscription and upload the downloaded format to a file share.
       See Microsoft documentation
       [Howto create a storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-how-to-create-file-share?tabs=azure-portal#create-a-storage-account)

        **This storage account has an account name and key. Store them as they are needed in the next steps.** They can be collected from the Azure portal.

    ### SAP Software
    The SAP software is available in different formats from the SAP Software Download Center.

    1. Installation & Upgrades

        Provides the software in `.zip` or multipart `.rar` archive format.

    2. Support Packages & Patches

        Provides the software mostly in `.SAR` format.

    ##### SAP HANA Example

    1. Installation & Upgrades

        The HANA platform edition contains all HANA components like HANA Database, Client, Studio, XS Engine etc.
        The multipart `rar` archive consists of a group of `.exe` and `.rar` files.
        To use an archive for the installation, it can be uploaded as it is (uploading all the files to the storage)
        or after extracting the contents. Find more information about how to extract in: https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/0001791258.
        The extracted HANA platform can be recognized checking the `LABEL.ASC` file in the main folder.
        It should look like (it can be a different version): `HDB:HANA:2.0:LINUX_X86_64:SAP HANA PLATFORM EDITION 2.0::BD51054084`

        Example: `51053381_part1.exe`, `51053381_part2.rar`, `51053381_part3.rar` and `51053381_part4.rar`

    2. Support Packages & Patches

        The archive consist of only the HANA Database Server component.
        It contains a particular patch level or revision of only the database component of HANA platform.
        To extract this option, the SAP `SAPCAR` utility is mandatory, which must be downloaded too.

        Example: `IMDB_SERVER_2_00_037_05.SAR` and `SAPCAR_1311_80000935.EXE`

    Upload the downloaded SAP files (or the extracted) version to the file share under a _new_ subfolder (`hana` as example). **This folder name is used later in the configuration.**

  # Markdown syntax is accepted - see https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax
  next_steps: |
    To destroy the currently created deployment run the following commands in the folder extracted from the downloaded file:

    ```terraform init```

    ```terraform workspace select $used_workspace```

    ```terraform destroy -auto-approve```

    To access the machines the next command can be used:<br>
    ```terraform output # get the addresses```

    ```ssh -o ProxyCommand="ssh -W %h:%p cloudadmin@{bastion_ip} -i {your_ssh_key} -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no" cloudadmin@{hana_ip} -i {your_ssh_key} -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no```
