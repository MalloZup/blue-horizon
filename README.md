## Requirements

Requirements are based on supported versions from SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP1.

* ruby 2.5.5
* rails 5.1.4
* puma 3.11.0
* sqlite3

## Contributing

The Ruby project uses [rvm](http://rvm.io/rvm/basics) to manage a virtual environment for development.

1.  Clone this project

2.  RVM will prompt you to install the required ruby version, if necessary, when entering the project directory.

3.  Install dependencies
    ```
    gem install bundler
    bundle
    ```
    If you have trouble with _nokogiri_, make sure you have development versions of _libxml2_ & _libxslt_ installed. On (open)SUSE:
    ```
    sudo zypper in libxml2-devel libxslt-devel
    ```

4.  Create a dotenv file (e.g. `.env.development`) that defines:
    *   The cloud framework
        ```
        CLOUD_FRAMEWORK="aws"
        ```

5.  Place original _terraform_ scripts in `/vendor/sources`

6.  Initialize a development database
    ```
    rails db:setup
    ```

7.  Start a development server on http://localhost:3000
    ```
    rails server -b localhost -p 3000
    ````

Before submitting a change, please be sure it passes all existing tests and conforms with our coding style:

```
rspec
rubocop
```

## Customization

_blue-horizon_ is pointless, without a set of terraform scripts to work from, and those scripts represent a "target application", which _blue-horizon_ can adapt to support. The `vendor` path is used by default to host content about the target application.

### Terraform sources

`.tf` and `.sh` files can be placed in `vendor/sources`, and loaded via `rails db:seed`.

To use a different path, set the environment variable `TERRAFORM_SOURCES_PATH` before seeding the database.

### String customization/localization

`.yml` and `.rb` files can be placed in `vendor/locales`, and will be loaded automatically.

See the
[Rails Internationalization Guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html#how-to-store-your-custom-translations)
for advice on formatting.

See `config/locales/custom-en.yml` for a sample/template with keys defined.

To use a different path, set the environment variable `BLUE_HORIZON_LOCALIZERS` with the directory where custom internationalization files are stored.

### Application customization

`vendor/customization.yml` defines configuration keys that can be modified to alter the behavior of the application.

See `config/initializers/customization.rb` for an explanation of the available keys and options.

To use a different path, set the environment variable `BLUE_HORIZON_CUSTOMIZER` with the full path of the customization YAML file to load.

## Packaging

_blue-horizon_ includes supporting tools and documents to build on an open build service (OBS) instance, such as https://build.opensuse.org

### New dependencies

1. When updating dependencies, add a categorized entry with a comment, in Gemfile.development. If the dependency is required in production, add the gemfile entry only, alphabetically, in Gemfile.production.

2. Run `rails gems:rpmspec:requires` and update the specfile (`packaging/blue-horizon.spec`) with the new dependency set.

### Generating a tarball

1. In order to produce a production-ready tarball, assets need to be precompiled, then the tarball built:
  ```
  RAILS_ENV=production rails assets:clobber assets:precompile obs:tar
  ```
2. Copy the specfile and move the tarball to an OBS project dir
  ```
  cp packaging/*.spec path/of/your/project/
  mv *.tar* path/of/your/project/
  ```
